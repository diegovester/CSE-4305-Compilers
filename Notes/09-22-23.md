## Why would compiler compile down to assembler instead of machine code?
Different architecture have different assembly language.
Assembly language across architectures are different, almost by definition.
Going to P-code, a level that is above machine code, is architecture indepedent.
It is applicable to multiple architecture, by being an abstraction of architecture concepts.
P-code is above machine code and assembly.
Assembly language is often different across architecured.

Why would compiler compile down to assembler instead of machine code?
1. To help insulate the code gen of the compiler
2. Assembler is architecture dependent. It is not portable across architectures

## What is a self-hosting compiler?
A compiler written in its own language

## What does cpp do?
It's a purely textual preprocesser

## source-to-source
A high level language translated to another separate high level language.

You cannot simply say translated to another language. Machine code is a language. Any compiler does that.

Formal Languages and their Relations to Automota

Certain kinds of errors are detected by distinct phases.
- target code generation errors (usually indicate internal errors in the compilers
- badly formed literals (most compilers dont let you stretch a string across two lines)
- illegal characters

Why are misspelled keywords not lexical errors?
- because it could be a valid identifier

Free form languages (C, Java) white space is meaningless unless it is inside a string literal.  
White space can also be useful to separate ambiguous tokens.
C has a token ++  
So if you have a token a++3, you probably meant postfix  

Languages with meaningful whitespace have rules that inhibit the author.

Discard comments
- some compilers take instruction from the comment
- directives in comments for the super perceptive compilers

## Tokens
A token is the basic building block of a program

## Some Generic Token Categories
