# Question 1
**For a translator to be a true compiler, what does it analyze? What is the resemblance of the generated IR to the source code?**

"We'll use "compiling" to mean that a complete analysis of the source code is done by the translator."




# Question 2
**What is an example of an operation in cpp?**  
cpp = contextual preprocessor  
Conditional Compilation  
#if Directive  
#ifdef Directive  
#ifndef Directive  
#else Directive  
#elif Directive  
#endif Directive

# Question 3
**Does a compiler "stick around" after the program is compiled? Explain.**

# Question 4
**What is JIT? Explain**
Just-In-Time Compilation
Compilation can be delayed until the last possible moment.
Allows for handling "on-the-fly" code, optimization based on run-time conditions, etc.
Also supports platform-independent intermediate representation that can be distributed and then compiled locally into machine code.
Examples include Java, C#

# Question 5
**What is REPL? Explain**
Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)

An interactive environment wherein the user types a line at a time which is then evaluated and results displayed.

- Read: Get Input from user
- Eval: Determine value
- Print: Display result to user
- Loop: Do again, until terminated
