**Compiler *and* Interpreting a Program**
Java
Sun converted byte code to machine code to render on a browser. They anticipated cloud computing. They were to early.

**Chain of Compilation**
Why would a source program generate an alternative source program, like C, instead of compiling down to Assembly?
	It would allow the person writing the language to compile down to C without worrying about the backend of compiling down to assembly.

C++ originally was envisioned to be a superset of C. It was a marketed as an advantage that a developer would not have to change their any line of their C program when adopting C++. They have abandoned this vision many years ago.

Java vs C#
	C# is like a mirror to Java. Microsoft running on intel chips was putting Sun out of business.
	Anyone could use the standard to develop a frontend that generated the byte code using Java.
	Sun tried to use Java as an advantage against Microsoft, but Microsoft created their own version of Java that was more efficient.

Algol is probably at the root of everything
COLBOL and ALGOL are completely different.


5:25 PM
1956 - 1960
FORTRAN, Lisp, ALGOL, COLBOL

The three most popular processors:
1. ARM
2. x86 Intel
3. MIPS
4. (maybe M1 will become popular?

British high tech
1. ARM
2. Raspberry Pi

ARM doesn't make chips. They license IP.
